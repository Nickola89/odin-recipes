        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagne (Italian: lasagne) is pasta, a thin sheet of dough in the shape of a square or rectangle, as well as an Italian dish traditionally made from thin sheets of dough (actually called lasagna) with layers of various fillings. In Italian, the dish, in contrast to the pasta used for it, can be called lasagne al forno (Italian: lasagne al forno).
        </p>
        <p>
            The most traditional filling for lasagna is a ragout with minced meat, béchamel sauce and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. However, in regional variants, the filling can be, in particular, from tomatoes, spinach, other vegetables, bolognese sauce, mozzarella or ricotta cheeses, in fact, the set of fillings is unlimited.
